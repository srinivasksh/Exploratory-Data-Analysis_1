# Exploratory-Data-Analysis_1

This is my repository for the Coursera - Exploratory Data Analysis course # 1. There are 4 R code files and 4 corresponding .png 
images that have the plots produced by the scripts.

To run the scripts, below steps need to be done:
1) Download the scripts to your local directory
2) Download the input data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip
3) Extract the data into your input directory
4) Run the scripts
5) The .png plots will be created in the same folder as the data
